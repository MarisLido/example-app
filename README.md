## About this project

- It can be also be run from the console.

Frontend part:
- Accessible only by username/password.
- All scraped information displayed using DataTables, 10 entries per package.
- Possibility to delete an item - if itâ€™s deleted, it will not be updated.

## Setup

In your terminal write:
- `composer install` to install all composer dependencies.
- `npm install` to install NPM dependencies.
- Make a copy of `.env.example` file.
- Provide your database connection data. If you want you can make sqlite connection by commenting out everything that starts with DB_, except DB_CONNECTION. Set that to 'sqlite'.
- `php artisan key:generate` to generate app encryption key.
- `php artisan migrate --seed` to generate data tables and seed default user.
- `npm run dev` and `php artisan serve` to start the application.

> php artisan `scraper:scrape` and `scraper:update`
